TeamCity Manager
================

Configure your TeamCity server using your Configuration Management system.

Built on the awesome [TeamCitySharp by @stack72](http://github.com/stack72/teamcitysharp) and the [TeamCity API](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/REST+API)

Testing
-------
I've tested it on TeamCity 8.1.3 - it should work on any version of TeamCity 8.1+ - but I haven't tested it on every version.

The TeamCity API has been pretty lacking in versions prior to 8.1 - so it probably won't work.

YMMV - pull requests are welcomed :)
